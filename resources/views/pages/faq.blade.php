	<dd>What data do you store?</dd>
	<dt>None about users, except on a very short term basis.  We cache game details, to avoid hammering the Steam server too much, but your user details and game libraries are fetched fresh every session.  We believe that your data belongs on the Steam server, where you put it.</dt>
	<dd>How can I remove my account from </dd>
	<dt>Your account is retrieved from the Steam server on each occasion; we don't store your data, and we don't want it.  Your Steam library is publicly accessible through the Steam API.  </dt>
	<dd>...Are you SURE this game is multiplayer?</dd>
	<dt>Nope!  Our data's polled from Steam categories, and if that data's wrong then so is ours.  My advice is that if it sounds idiotic, check Youtube for multiplayer gameplay videos.</dt>
